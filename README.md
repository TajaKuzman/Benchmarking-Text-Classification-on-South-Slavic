# Benchmarking Text Classification Tasks on South Slavic languages

The repository comprises code and results for benchmarking non-neural methods, fine-tuned BERT-like models and instruction-tuned GPT models on three benchmarks that comprise South Slavic languages and focus on text classification:
- [automatic genre identification in web texts](Genre-Automatic-Identification-Benchmark)
- [news topic classification](IPTC-NewsTopic-Benchmark)
- [sentiment classification in parliamentary texts](ParlaSent-Benchmark)

The experiments and results are further discussed in a paper by Kuzman Punger≈°ek et al., to be published.
